			<h2>DISCLAIMER</h2>

			<p>
				Before making any purchase of content or using any information
				from the A-Style service, it is crucial to thoroughly read this
				disclaimer. A-Style is an independent service that provides
				stock trading ideas. All information provided by the A-Style
				service is strictly for informational and educational purposes.
				Neither A-Style nor its employees are registered investment
				advisors or broker-dealers. Our recommendations solely represent
				our opinions on how to conduct stock, ETF, or mutual fund
				trading. Our guidance does not constitute suggestions to buy,
				sell, or hold a security. We do not receive compensation from
				any of the companies we recommend. Past outcomes are not
				indicative of future returns. Prior to making any investment
				based on recommendations from this service, it is advisable to
				consult with your authorized financial advisor and tax
				consultant. Please understand that the information provided on
				A-Style, its applications, and services is intended to provide a
				general understanding of investment opinions and does not
				constitute tax, investment, or legal advice. Consult your
				financial, tax, or legal advisor regarding your unique
				situation, and consult your company's representative for rules
				specific to your plan. The opinions expressed by this service do
				not encourage the purchase or sale of stocks. The
				recommendations are provided solely for entertainment reading
				purposes, and no responsibilities will be assumed for opinions
				expressed and/or provided by A-Style. CFTC Rule 4.41 states that
				hypothetical or simulated performance results have certain
				limitations. Unlike actual performance records, simulated
				results do not reflect actual trading. Furthermore, since the
				trades have not been executed, the results may have
				overcompensated or undercompensated for the impact, if any, of
				certain market factors, such as a lack of liquidity. Simulated
				trading programs, in general, are also subject to the fact that
				they are designed with the benefit of hindsight. No
				representation is being made that any account will or is likely
				to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown.{" "}
